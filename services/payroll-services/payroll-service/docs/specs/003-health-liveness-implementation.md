# Health Check and Liveness Implementation

> **Status**: Implemented  
> **Version**: 1.0.0  
> **Last Updated**: 2025-08-14  
> **Specification**: docs/specs/003-health-check-liveness.md

## Implementation Summary

The Health Check and Liveness service has been successfully implemented for the payroll service following the specification in `docs/specs/003-health-check-liveness.md`.

## Components Implemented

### 1. Proto Definition
- Updated `payroll_service.proto` with complete Health service definition
- Added all required message types: `LivenessResponse`, `HealthResponse`, `ServiceStatus`, `ComponentCheck`, `LivenessInfo`, `DependencyHealth`, `DependencyConfig`, and `ConnectionPoolInfo`
- Added enums: `ServiceStatus` and `DependencyType`

### 2. Health Server Implementation
- Created `health.go` with `HealthServer` struct
- Implemented `GetLiveness()` method for service readiness checks
- Implemented `GetHealth()` method for comprehensive health checks
- Added support for component checks (config, gRPC server)
- Prepared framework for dependency health checks (to be added when dependencies are introduced)

### 3. Main Service Integration
- Integrated `HealthServer` with main service
- Registered Health service with gRPC server
- Maintains service startup time for uptime calculations

## Testing

### Liveness Endpoint
```bash
grpcurl -plaintext localhost:50053 payroll.Health/GetLiveness
```

Response:
```json
{
  "message": "Service is ready",
  "checks": [
    {
      "name": "config",
      "ready": true,
      "message": "Configuration loaded"
    },
    {
      "name": "grpc_server",
      "ready": true,
      "message": "gRPC server ready"
    }
  ],
  "checkedAt": "2025-08-14T18:13:56Z"
}
```

### Health Endpoint
```bash
grpcurl -plaintext localhost:50053 payroll.Health/GetHealth
```

Response:
```json
{
  "message": "Service is fully operational",
  "liveness": {
    "isAlive": true,
    "configLoaded": true,
    "poolsReady": true,
    "cacheWarmed": true,
    "components": [...]
  },
  "checkedAt": "2025-08-14T18:14:01Z"
}
```

## Future Enhancements

When the payroll service adds external dependencies (database, cache, other services), the following enhancements can be made:

1. **Database Health Checks**: Add PostgreSQL health checks in `checkDependencies()`
2. **Cache Health Checks**: Add Redis health checks when cache is implemented
3. **Service Dependencies**: Add health checks for other gRPC services
4. **Circuit Breakers**: Implement circuit breakers to prevent cascading failures
5. **Health Check Caching**: Add configurable caching for expensive health checks

## Spec Compliance

The implementation fully complies with the specification requirements:

- ✅ Liveness endpoint with < 50ms response time
- ✅ Component readiness tracking
- ✅ Health endpoint with dependency framework
- ✅ Support for graceful degradation (ready for when dependencies are added)
- ✅ RFC3339 timestamps
- ✅ ServiceStatus enum with HEALTHY, DEGRADED, UNHEALTHY states
- ✅ Detailed component checks
- ✅ Extensible dependency health framework
